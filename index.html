        To make learning resources available through a single-window to the
        learners, National Mission on Education through Information and
        Communication Technology (NMEICT) has sponsored the National Digital
        Library of India (NDLI) project and arranged funding through Ministry of
        Education.

        The library discovery initiative is intended to make finding resources
        clear and easy for users. Sadeh (2007: 310) puts it well: “Unlike
        librarians, users are not aware of whether a resource is locally hosted
        or remotely hosted, free or licensed, MARC formatted or Dublin Core
        formatted, so libraries need to create an integrated, coherent
        environment that renders these distinctions invisible to the user.” Why
        stop, then, at just library resources and holdings? Why not include all
        library content, including the information the library provides about
        itself? Some libraries have moved toward this concept by applying a
        creative mind to what they put in their catalog. The Orange County
        Library System in Florida, for example, marketed programs, databases and
        library services through its catalog by creating MARC records for them
        (Bost and Conklin, 2006). At the University of Michigan, librarians
        themselves are cataloged and easily found through a keyword search in
        the main discovery tool. The discoverability of a library LibGuides
        subject guides through Summon is also an important development, as it
        connects the initial search tool to deeper, curated learning tools.
